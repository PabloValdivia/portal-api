# Idempiere Portal API
> 

This server side plugin is created to show how API REST can be used in OSGI Idempiere Environment.

It's based on Spring Framework, Spring Security & Swagger integration:



## Installing / Getting started

To build this plugin you need to get sources in your project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/icreated/portal-api.git
```
**Important!**
Edit pom.xml to link native Idempiere libraries with parent project.
If you put sources directly in Idempiere sources folder, it will be

```xml
<relativePath>../org.idempiere.parent/pom.xml</relativePath>
```
like others Idempiere plugins, otherwise modify it.
